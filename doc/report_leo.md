: Test Signal Generator - Description of I/O Signals

The test signal generator with its multiple I/Os can be broken down into 4 distinctive parts:
- serial data handling
- pulse width modulation generator
- pattern generator
- random noise generator

![Test Signal Generator Breakup Drawing](images/breakup_tsg.png){width=100%}
In the picture above you can recognize that the register file is the central part of the design. 
The register file receives data from the serial communication and writes them into its memory. Depending on the values in the 
memory the output components are controlled. 

The register file has the following memory view.
```
		  					 Bit7  ..         0
------------------------------------------------
Address  	Name 				7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
------------------------------------------------
0x00 
0x01  		system control 					x x
0x02
0x03
0x04     	pwm pulse width 	x x x x x x x x
0x05 		pwm period 			x x x x x x x x
0x06 		pwm control 					x x
0x07
0x08 		noise prbsg length 	x x x x x x x x
0x09 		noise period 		x x x x x x x x
0x0A
0x0B 		noise control 					x x
0x0C 		pattern length 		x x x x x x x x
0x0D 
0x0E 		pattern period 		x x x x x x x x
0x0F 		pattern control 			  x x x
```

The meaning of the control parts of the registers is explained in the following.
```
system control
---------------------------
Bit 0 Meaning
------------------------
	0 system disable
	1 system enable
---------------------------
Bit 1 Meaning
---------------------------
	1 system clear [synchronous clear](not currently implemented see improvements!)


pwm control
---------------------------
Bit 0 Meaning
--------------------------
	0 pwm off
	1 pwm on
---------------------------
Bit 1 Meaning
---------------------------
	0 internal trigger
	1 external trigger


noise prbsg length
-----------------------------------------
Bit 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Meaning
-----------------------------------------
			  0 0 0 4-bit
			  0 0 1 7-bit 8B/10B-encoded pattern

			  0 1 1 17-bit OIF-CEI-P-02.0
			  1 0 0 20-bit ITU-T O.150
			  1 0 1 23-bit ITU-T O.150

noise control
---------------------------
Bit 0 Meaning
---------------------------
	0 noise off
	1 noise on
---------------------------
Bit 1 Meaning
---------------------------
	0 internal trigger
	1 external trigger

pattern control
---------------------------
Bit 1 0 Meaning
---------------------------
	0 0 stop
	0 1 single burst
	1 0 continous run
	1 1 load data
---------------------------
Bit 2 Meaning
---------------------------
	0 internal trigger
	1 external trigger
```
Now the control part of the register will be explained in further detail. 
The system has an general enable "system control" which must be switched on 
to switch on all individual components (noise, pattern, pwm). All components 
allow for external triggering where you can change the state manually by pressing 
a button. When not specified the compents run with the speed of the external time 
base which is further divided by the individual period settings. This will be discussed 
in further detail in the Design Description.
